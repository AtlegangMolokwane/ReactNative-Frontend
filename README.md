# ReactNative-Frontend

## My apologies for not putting the backend and front end in the same repo

## Creating new Url to fatch data (First thing first)
- You have to run " lt --port 8000 " to generate new url for it to work on your mobile, then replace the old one with the new one it in AppStack.js(line 12) and in AuthProvider.js(10), "const url" 
- The http://localhost:800 did not work fo me hence this technic

## To run script
- run npm start

## Challenges faced
- I was not able to create a profile page where you could edit the user name and image.
- I was also not able create the Search because of time.
- When performing the CRUD, the data gets updated after you have reloaded the script again. 
e.g after deleting, adding or editing item, you wont be able to see the changes unless you reload the script. I believe with your guidance I will be able to make it refresh autometically.
